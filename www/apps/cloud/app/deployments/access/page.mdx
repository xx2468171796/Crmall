In this guide, you'll learn how to access your Cloud [deployment](../page.mdx) for an environment.

## Access Live Deployment

You can only access a deployment of an [environment](../../environments/page.mdx) once its status is "Live". A live deployment means that your Medusa application is successfully built and is publicly accessible. You can't access previous deployments or deployments that are still in the "Building" or "Failed" status.

You can access the live deployment's Medusa Admin, send requests to its API routes, and access its storefront (if applicable) using the deployment's environment URL.

## Find Backend and Admin's URL

<Note>

For preview environments, refer to the [Preview Environments](../../environments/preview/page.mdx#access-deployed-preview-environment) guide to find the URL of the preview environment.

</Note>

An environment's backend URL is in the format `<subdomain>.medusajs.app`, where `<subdomain>` is the subdomain you set either when [creating its project](../../projects/page.mdx#create-a-project) or when [creating the environment](../../environments/long-lived/page.mdx#create-a-long-lived-environment).

You can also find the URL of a deployment's backend through the Cloud dashboard:

1. Select a project from the [organization's dashboard](../../organizations/page.mdx#organization-dashboard).
2. In the project's dashboard, find the backend URL in the environment's card under the "Backend" title. You can copy the URL by clicking the copy icon next to it.

3. You can also click on the environment's name to open its dashboard, where you'll find the URL under the environment's name.

### Access the Deployment's Medusa Admin

To access the Medusa Admin of a live deployment, click on [the environment's URL](#find-backend-and-admins-url), or navigate to `<environment-url>/app`. For example, if your environment's URL is `my-project.medusajs.app`, navigate to `my-project.medusajs.app/app`.

You can then log in either using:

1. The email and password set either [during project creation](../../projects/page.mdx#create-a-project).
2. Your existing Cloud account by clicking the "Log in with Medusa Cloud" button. A user will be created in the Medusa application with the same email as your Cloud account.

### Can't Find the Log in with Medusa Cloud Button?

If you don't see the "Log in with Medusa Cloud" button on the Medusa Admin log in page, make sure that:

1. Your Medusa application's version is using [Medusa v2.12.4 or later](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.12.4).
2. If your deployed project was created before Medusa v2.12.4, set the [environment variable](../../environments/environment-variables/page.mdx) `MEDUSA_CLOUD_OAUTH_DISABLED` to `false` in the environment's settings, then redeploy the environment.

---

## Send Requests to the Deployed Medusa Backend

You can send requests to a live deployment's Medusa backend using the deployment's [environment URL](#find-backend-and-admins-url).

For example, to check the health of the live deployment, you can send a `GET` request to the `/health` endpoint:

```bash
curl https://my-project.medusajs.app/health
```

Where `https://my-project.medusajs.app` is the URL of the environment's Medusa backend.

---

## Access Deployment's Server through SSH

Medusa doesn't support SSH access to the server instance of a deployment. However, you can still access the server's [runtime and build logs](../../logs/page.mdx) to debug issues in your application.

If this isn't sufficient for your use case, you can contact support to discuss alternatives.

---

## Find Storefront URL

If you deployed a storefront alongside your Medusa backend, you can access it using the storefront URL.

By default, storefronts are deployed at the `medusajs.site` subdomain. The domain prefix is the same as the Medusa backend's subdomain. For example, if your backend is at `my-store.medusajs.app`, your storefront will be at `my-store.medusajs.site`.

You can find the storefront URL:

1. Select a project from the [organization's dashboard](../../organizations/page.mdx#organization-dashboard).
2. In the project's dashboard, find the storefront URL in the environment's card under the "Storefront" title. You can copy the URL by clicking the copy icon next to it.
3. Click the URL to open the storefront in a new browser tab.

You can also set up a custom domain for your storefront. Learn more in the [Storefront Custom Domain](../../storefront/page.mdx#storefront-custom-domain) guide.
