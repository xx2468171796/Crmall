## Create Medusa Application Locally

A Medusa application is made up of a Node.js server and a Vite admin dashboard. You can optionally install the [Next.js Starter Storefront](!resources!/nextjs-starter) separately either while installing the Medusa application or at a later point.

<Note>

While this is the recommended way to create a Medusa application, you can alternatively [install a Medusa application with Docker](./docker/page.mdx).

</Note>

<Prerequisites items={[

To create a Medusa application, use the `create-medusa-app` command:

<Note title="Tip">

Considering using `yarn` or `pnpm` as your package manager for quicker installations and better performance. `npm` installations are generally slower.

</Note>

<CodeTabs group="npm2yarn">
  <CodeTab label="yarn" value="yarn">

```bash
yarn dlx create-medusa-app@latest my-medusa-store
# npx create-medusa-app@latest my-medusa-store --use-yarn
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="pnpm" value="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm dlx create-medusa-app@latest my-medusa-store
# npx create-medusa-app@latest my-medusa-store --use-pnpm
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="npm" value="npm">

```bash
npx create-medusa-app@latest my-medusa-store
```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

Where `my-medusa-store` is the name of the project's directory and PostgreSQL database created for the project. When you run the command, you'll be asked whether you want to install the Next.js Starter Storefront.

<Note title="Installations with Next.js Starter Storefront">

If you choose to install the Next.js Starter Storefront, note that it currently doesn't support Node v25+. Make sure to downgrade to Node v24 LTS or lower before installing the Medusa application with the storefront.

</Note>

<Note>

To customize the default installation behavior, such as specify a database URL, refer to the [create-medusa-app reference](!resources!/create-medusa-app).

</Note>

After answering the prompts, the command installs the Medusa application in a directory with your project name, and sets up a PostgreSQL database that the application connects to.

If you chose to install the storefront with the Medusa application, the storefront is installed in a separate directory named `{project-name}-storefront`.

### Successful Installation Result

Once the installation finishes successfully, the Medusa application will run at `http://localhost:9000`.

The Medusa Admin dashboard also runs at `http://localhost:9000/app`. The installation process opens the Medusa Admin dashboard in your default browser to create a user. You can later log in with that user.

If you also installed the Next.js Starter Storefront, it'll be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

You can stop the servers for the Medusa application and Next.js Starter Storefront by exiting the installation command. To run the server for the Medusa application again, refer to [this section](#run-medusa-application-in-development).

### Troubleshooting Installation Errors

If you ran into an error during your installation, refer to the following troubleshooting guides for help:

1. [create-medusa-app troubleshooting guides](!resources!/troubleshooting/create-medusa-app-errors).
2. [CORS errors](!resources!/troubleshooting/cors-errors).
3. [Errors with pnpm](!resources!/troubleshooting/pnpm).
4. [All troubleshooting guides](!resources!/troubleshooting).

If you can't find your error reported anywhere, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/issues/new/choose).

## Run Medusa Application in Development

To run the Medusa application in development, change to your application's directory and run the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

This runs your Medusa server at `http://localhost:9000`, and the Medusa Admin dashboard `http://localhost:9000/app`.

![Diagram showcasing the server and application running when you start the Medusa application](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1745856966/Medusa%20Resources/start-overview_aetplx.jpg)

<Note title="Tip">

For details on starting and configuring the Next.js Starter Storefront, refer to [this documentation](!resources!/nextjs-starter).

</Note>

The application will restart if you make any changes to code under the `src` directory, except for admin customizations which are hot reloaded, providing you with a seamless developer experience without having to refresh your browser to see the changes.

## Start Building with Claude Code

Medusa provides [Claude Code plugins](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa-claude-plugins) to assist you in learning and building with Medusa.

This section covers key plugins as you get started with Medusa development using Claude Code. Refer to the [Build with AI Assistants and LLMs](../introduction/build-with-llms-ai/page.mdx) chapter for more details on using Medusa with AI tools.

### Interactive Learning with Claude Code

If you're a Medusa beginner and use Claude Code, install the `learn-medusa` plugin:

```bash
claude # start claude code
/plugin marketplace add medusajs/medusa-claude-plugins
/plugin install learn-medusa@medusa
```

Then, start the learning experience with this prompt:

```bash title="Claude Code Prompt"
I want to learn Medusa.
```

<Note title="Tip">

You can also run the skill using the `/learn-medusa:learning-medusa` command in Claude Code.

</Note>

This starts the interactive learning experience where you'll learn Medusa concepts step-by-step by building a brands feature, similar to the [Brands tutorial](../customization/custom-features/page.mdx). You will:

1. Create a Brand Module with API routes to manage brands.
2. Link brands to products to associate products with brands.
3. Customize the Medusa Admin dashboard to allow admin users to manage brands.

By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of Medusa's architecture and how to build custom features.

### Medusa Development Assistant

If you want assistance in your Medusa development and use Claude Code, install the `medusa-dev` plugin:

```bash
claude # start claude code
/plugin marketplace add medusajs/medusa-claude-plugins
/plugin install medusa-dev@medusa
```

Then, you can ask Claude Code to build Medusa features, fix bugs, and more. Claude Code will use the skills in the plugin to provide you with accurate and relevant Medusa code.

Examples of prompts you can use:

```bash title="Claude Code Prompts"
Implement a product reviews feature. Authenticated customers can add reviews. Admin users can view and approve or reject reviews from the dashboard
Create a wishlist feature where customers can save products. I need API routes for adding/removing items and retrieving the wishlist.
Add a widget to the product detail page in the admin that allows managing related products. Admin users should be able to select which products are related using a searchable table.
Help me integrate the custom reviews API into my Next.js storefront. Show product reviews on the product detail page with pagination.
```

---

## Create Medusa Admin User

Aside from creating an admin user in the admin dashboard, you can create a user with Medusa's CLI tool.

Run the following command in your Medusa application's directory to create a new admin user:

```bash npx2yarn
npx medusa user -e admin@medusajs.com -p supersecret
```

Replace `admin@medusajs.com` and `supersecret` with the user's email and password respectively.

You can then use the user's credentials to log into the Medusa Admin application.

---

## Project Files

Your Medusa application's project will have the following files and directories:

![A diagram of the directories overview](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1732803813/Medusa%20Book/medusa-dir-overview_v7ks0j.jpg)
