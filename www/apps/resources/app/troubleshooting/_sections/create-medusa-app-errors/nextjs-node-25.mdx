If you install the Next.js Starter Storefront with Node v25+, you may encounter the following error when starting the storefront:

```bash
[TypeError: localStorage.getItem is not a function]
```

### Why this Error Occurred

This error occurs because the Next.js Starter Storefront uses Next.js v15.3.8, which doesn't yet support Node v25+.

The error is related to changes in Node v25+ that affect how certain web APIs, like `localStorage`, are handled in server-side environments.

### How to Fix it

Our team is actively working on updating the Next.js Starter Storefront to support Node v25+. In the meantime, you can resolve this error by downgrading your Node.js version to v24 LTS or lower.
