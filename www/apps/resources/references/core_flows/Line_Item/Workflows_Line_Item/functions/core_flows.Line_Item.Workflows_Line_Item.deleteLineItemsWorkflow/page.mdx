# deleteLineItemsWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `deleteLineItemsWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow deletes line items from a cart. It's used by the
[Delete Line Item Store API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#carts\_deletecartsidlineitemsline\_id).

You can use this workflow within your customizations or your own custom workflows, allowing you to
delete line items from a cart within your custom flows.

:::note

If you use this workflow in another, you must acquire a lock before running it and release the lock after. Learn more in the [Locking Operations in Workflows](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/locks#locks-in-nested-workflows) guide.

## Emitted Events

This section lists the events that are either triggered by the `emitEventStep` in the workflow, or by another workflow executed within this workflow.

:::note

The `emitEventStep` only emits the event after the workflow has finished successfully. So, even if it's executed in the middle of the workflow, it won't actually emit the event until the workflow has completed successfully. If the workflow fails, it won't emit the event at all.

:::

You can listen to these events in a subscriber, as explained in the [Subscribers](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/events-and-subscribers) documentation.
