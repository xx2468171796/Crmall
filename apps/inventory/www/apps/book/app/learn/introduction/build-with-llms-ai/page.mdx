In this chapter, you'll learn how you can use AI assistants and LLMs effectively in your Medusa development.

## Claude Code Plugins

Medusa provides [Claude Code plugins](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa-claude-plugins) to assist you in learning and building with Medusa.

If you use Claude Code, our team recommends installing these plugins to enhance your development experience with Medusa.

### Medusa Development Assistant

If you want assistance in your Medusa development and you use Claude Code, install the `medusa-dev` plugin:

```bash
claude # start claude code
/plugin marketplace add medusajs/medusa-claude-plugins
/plugin install medusa-dev@medusa
```

Then, you can ask Claude Code to build Medusa features, fix bugs, and more. Claude Code will use the skills in the plugin to provide you with accurate and relevant Medusa code.

Examples of prompts you can use:

```bash title="Claude Code Prompts"
Implement a product reviews feature. Authenticated customers can add reviews. Admin users can view and approve or reject reviews from the dashboard
Create a wishlist feature where customers can save products. I need API routes for adding/removing items and retrieving the wishlist.
Add a widget to the product detail page in the admin that allows managing related products. Admin users should be able to select which products are related using a searchable table.
Help me integrate the custom reviews API into my Next.js storefront. Show product reviews on the product detail page with pagination.
```

#### Claude Code Commands

The plugin also provides the following commands you can use in Claude Code:

### Interactive Learning with Claude Code

If you're a Medusa beginner and use Claude Code, install the `learn-medusa` plugin to start an interactive learning experience:

```bash
claude # start claude code
/plugin marketplace add medusajs/medusa-claude-plugins
/plugin install learn-medusa@medusa
```

Then, start the learning experience with this prompt:

```bash title="Claude Code Prompt"
I want to learn Medusa.
```

<Note title="Tip">

You can also run the skill using the `/learn-medusa:learning-medusa` command in Claude Code.

</Note>

This starts the interactive learning experience where you'll learn Medusa concepts step-by-step by building a brands feature, similar to the [Brands tutorial](../../customization/custom-features/page.mdx). You will:

1. Create a Brand Module with API routes to manage brands.
2. Link brands to products to associate products with brands.
3. Customize the Medusa Admin dashboard to allow admin users to manage brands.

By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of Medusa's architecture and how to build custom features.

### Use Claude Code Plugins with Other AI Tools

The Claude Code plugins include skills, MCP server configurations, and commands. These features are also available in other AI tools like Cursor.

So, if you don't use Claude Code, you can use the assets in the plugins either by copying them manually or using the [skills](https://skills.sh/) command.

#### Copy with Skills Command

To use the skills with other AI tools like Cursor, you can use the [skills](https://skills.sh/) command. Run the following command in your Medusa project directory:

```bash npx2yarn
npx skills add medusajs/medusa-claude-plugins
```

You'll be prompted to select which skills you want to add and what AI tool you want to add them to. The command will copy the necessary files to your AI tool's configuration directories.

The `skills` command only copies skill files. So, if you want to use the MCP server configurations and commands, you'll need to copy them manually as explained in the next section.

#### Copy Manually

You can also copy the skills, MCP server configurations, and commands manually to your AI tool's configuration directories. This is useful if your AI tool is not supported by the skills command, or you want to copy everything, not just specific skills.

To do this, refer to the documentation of your AI tool on where to place skills, MCP server configurations, and commands. Then, copy the relevant files from the [medusa-claude-plugins repository](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa-claude-plugins) to those directories.

For example, if you're using Cursor and you want to use the `medusa-dev` plugin, you can:

1. Copy the [skills directories](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa-claude-plugins/tree/main/plugins/medusa-dev/skills) to the `.cursor/skills` directory of your Medusa project.
2. Add the [MCP server configuration](#mcp-remote-server) to the `.cursor/mcp.json` file of your Medusa project.
3. Add the [commands](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa-claude-plugins/tree/main/plugins/medusa-dev/commands) to the `.cursor/commands` directory of your Medusa project.

You can then use these skills, MCP server, and commands in Cursor to assist you in your Medusa development.

## MCP Remote Server

The Medusa documentation provides a remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows you to find information from the Medusa documentation right in your IDEs or AI tools, such as Cursor.

Medusa hosts a Streamable HTTP MCP server at `https://docs.medusajs.com/mcp` that you can add to AI agents supporting MCP server connections.

### How to Use the MCP Server

After connecting to the Medusa MCP server in your AI tool or IDE, you can start asking questions or requesting your AI assistant to build Medusa customizations. It will fetch the relevant information from the Medusa documentation and provide you with accurate answers, code snippets, and explanations.

For example, you can ask:

1. "Create a Product Review module for Medusa. Refer to the Medusa documentation for information."
2. "How to update Medusa to the latest version?"
3. "Explain the Medusa workflow system."
4. "Integrate Medusa with X provider. Refer to the Medusa documentation for information."

## Plain Text Documentation

The Medusa documentation is available in plain text format, allowing LLMs and AI tools to easily parse and understand the content.

You can access the following plain text documentation files:

- [llms.txt](https://docs.medusajs.com/llms.txt) - Contains a short structure of links to important documentation pages.
- [llms-full.txt](https://docs.medusajs.com/llms-full.txt) - Contains the full documentation content, including all pages and sections.
- **Markdown version of any page** - You can access the Markdown version of any documentation page by appending `/index.html.md` to the page URL. For example, the plain text content of the current page is available at [https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/introduction/build-with-llms-ai/index.html.md](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/introduction/build-with-llms-ai/index.html.md).

You can provide these files to your AI tools or LLM editors like [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-docs). This helps them understand the Medusa documentation and provide better assistance when building customizations or answering questions.
